# Certificates
This repository showcases a collection of certificates I have earned by completing professional and academic courses in IT and Computer Science.
Each folder includes:

- a PDF copy of the certificate
- a detailed `README.md` file describing the course content, skills acquired, and personal insights

My goal is to present my ongoing professional development in a transparent and structured way.
